Limit Order Book -

June, 2011 - A recent poll (conducted by the OST Project) of financial market 
professionals debating the merits of various software technologies for financial 
markets led to little consensus on the best choice for implementing large-scale 
financial market trading solutions. 

Some consensus amongst those surveyed existed reguarding broad paradaigms:
Scalability
Multitenancy
Performance concerns 

Respondants to the poll also largely chose 'Java' as: "The best object-oriented
language for implementing a large-scale market trading application". 

The second most popular response was: "Something Else", referring broadly too 
object-oriented functional languages: OCaml impelementations such as F#, and
some verson of Python.
